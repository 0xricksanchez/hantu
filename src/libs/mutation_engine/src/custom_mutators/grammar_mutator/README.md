# README

This is a custom implementation of a grammar generator.
It uses hand-rolled grammar definitions in a JSON format to
generate somewhat valid output formats. The initial batch
of grammars are far from complete and can serve at best as
a starting point to overcome early fuzzing road-blocks.
This is often already plenty for fuzzing as other fuzzer
guiding metrics should handle the rest like picking the best
seeds to increase code-coverage in a fuzzing campaign
